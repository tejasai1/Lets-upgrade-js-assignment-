    <h1>DATA TYPES IN JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
    <p>they are 8 types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>number</li>
        <li>string</li>
        <li>boolean</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>undefined</li>
        <li>symbol</li>
        <li>bigint</li>
        <li>object</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>NUMBER</h2>
    <p>Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. There is not a specific type for integers.
        The number type has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not-a-number).
        You can use the constants Number.MAX_VALUE or Number.MIN_VALUE for the largest and smallest available value.
        You can use the constantsNumber.MAX_SAFE_INTEGERand Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER for checking safety for integer.
        </p>
      <h2>STRING</h2> 
      <p>The string type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String.
        The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it.
        </p>
        <h2>Boolean</h2> 
        <p>Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.
            All the values below are considered false when they are converted/coerced to a boolean value. 
            That is, they are considered “falsey” in JavaScript because type coercion in JavaScript will convert them to false</p>
            <h2>Null</h2>
            <p>The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
                Null is often retrieved in a place where an object can be expected but no object is relevant.
                 A variable that is set to null is declared as intentionally nothing/empty.</p>
           <h2>Undefined</h2>
           <p>The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined .
            A variable that has NOT been assigned a value is of type undefined.
            A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
            </p>  
            <h2>Symbol</h2> 
            <p>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.
                Symbols don’t auto-convert to “strings”
                </p>  
            <h2>BigInt</h2>   
            <p>BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. You can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit.
                A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer literal.
                </p> 
             <h2>Object</h2>  
             <p>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. There are two types of object properties which have certain attributes: the data property and the accessor property.
                The Data property: associates a key with a value.
                The accessor property: associates a key with one or two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store value.
                In JavaScript, both arrays and functions are objects. An array is just an object whose keys are integers,
                 it contains methods to operate on the array. A function is just an “executable object”.</p>
